    "weCanBeTrustedQ": "1. How to make sure we can be trusted?",
    "weCanBeTrustedA": "We don't need to be trusted! You do not transfer funds to us, but only connect your existing account on the exchange through the API protocol without withdrawal permission, only with the right to make transactions on your behalf. Your chosen exchange will continue to be responsible for the safety of your funds.",
    "amoundOfMoneyToStartQ": "2. What amount of money do I need to start using the TSFC app?",
    "amoundOfMoneyToStartA": "Now you don't need huge savings to build up an investment portfolio. TSFC allows you to use its Prime product with any amount, but it is worth keeping in mind that the effectiveness of smaller portfolios may differ as they allow fewer trades to be opened.",
    "howTheWorkIsGoingQ": "3. How do I see what you've purchased and how the work is going?",
    "howTheWorkIsGoingA": "To view your transaction history and current positions in the TSFC app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to the TSFC app.\n2. Go to Product: Click on the Product you are interested in.\n3. View Current Positions: The screen will display all current positions.\n4. Transaction History: Locate and click on the “Transaction History” button to open more detailed information on all transactions made, including dates, times, transaction types, and results.\n\nThis process allows you to keep track of how trades are performing and get detailed information about your investment activity at any time.",
    "howToPayMyFeeQ": "4. How do I pay my fee when I work with TSFC?",
    "howToPayMyFeeA": "You pay for our services once a quarter through our app. There you will find a special “Pay Fee” button in your active Prime section, which you can use to make your payment. If the fee is not paid at the end of the month, your account will be automatically suspended. In case of technical problems with payment through the app, our manager will contact you personally.",
    "canIWithdrawPartOfMyFundsQ": "5. Can I withdraw part or all of my funds from my exchange account?",
    "canIWithdrawPartOfMyFundsA": "Yes, you can withdraw part or the whole amount at any time. However, we ask you to notify us in advance of your intention to withdraw funds. This will help us better manage the process and ensure that your portfolio is balanced in a timely manner.",
    "whyTheTransactionHistoryNotShownQ": "6. Why is transaction history not yet shown and when will it be become available?",
    "whyTheTransactionHistoryNotShownA": "Within 24 hours after connecting your account, the process of forming your investment portfolio will begin. Our team will start making trades that will be carefully selected to optimize your profits. As soon as the first of these trades is closed, your transaction history will be available for viewing. You will be able to track all activity and updates directly in your personal account in the TSFC app.",
    "noEmailCodeQ": "7. What should I do if the email with the code doesn't appear in my email?",
    "noEmailCodeA": "Check your spam folder (via the mail service in your browser, not via the app). If the problem persists, contact our manager for further assistance.",
    "chartIsNotDisplayingQ": "8. Why is my chart not displaying in the TSFC app?",
    "chartIsNotDisplayingA": "Sufficient data history is required to display a graph. The minimum interval for display is 24 hours. If the chart is still not displayed after 24 hours or there are other problems, please contact our support team. We will promptly help you to resolve the situation.",
    "howToDepositFundsQ": "9. How to deposit funds on account after connecting API keys?",
    "howToDepositFundsA": "To deposit to the account, you need to transfer funds to the exchange account or sub-account linked to the application via API keys. Make sure that you send funds to the account that is linked to TSFC. For convenience, it is recommended to use USDT."
